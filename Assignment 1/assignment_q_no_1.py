# Q 1. Write a python program to get the fibonacci series between 0 to 50 .


num_1 = 0
num_2 = 1
num_3 = 1
print("Fibonacci series between 0 to 50 are :-",end = " " )
print(num_1,num_2,end = " ")
while num_3<=50:
     print(num_3,end = " ")
     num_1 = num_2
     num_2 = num_3
     num_3 = num_1 + num_2
